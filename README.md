# 💸 Fake Currency Detection using CNN + SVM/XGBoost

A computer vision-based project to detect fake Indian currency notes using deep learning and traditional machine learning. This model uses **CNN** to extract deep features from note images and applies classifiers like **SVM** and **XGBoost** to detect whether a currency note is real or fake.


## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧠 CNN used as a feature extractor (not classifier)
- 🤖 Ensemble learning with both **SVM** and **XGBoost**
- 📷 Real-time prediction on new note images
- 📊 Accuracy comparison between CNN+SVM and CNN+XGBoost

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
