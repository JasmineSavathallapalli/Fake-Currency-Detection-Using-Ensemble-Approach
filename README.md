# Fake Currency Detection Using Ensemble Approach
This project focuses on detecting fake Indian currency notes using an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and traditional machine learning classifiers like SVM and XGBoost for classification. The system processes images of currency notes and accurately distinguishes between real and fake notes.
